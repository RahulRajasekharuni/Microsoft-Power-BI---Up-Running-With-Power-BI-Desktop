# Microsoft Power BI - Up & Running With Power BI Desktop

Screenshots of the final dashboards I created whilst doing the "Microsoft Power BI - Up & Running With Power BI Desktop" course. The course taught me; how to connect and shape data, creating table relationships & data models, analysing data with DAX calculations and visualising data.

Some of the more advanced things I have learnt include;

1.What If parameters
2. Drill through filters
3. Time intelligence DAX formulas
4. Iterator ("X") functions
5. Calculate function with advanced filters such as using related tables
6. Filter flow and filter context
